<div class="article">
    <p class="h2">Britpop rules the world. Indie kickstarts the millennium.</p>
    <p class="p">In the 90s, Britpop took over the UK, with Manchester leading the way. This decade saw the city produce bands that became part of British cultural identity, and it didn’t stop there. The influence carried into the 2000s as Manchester’s indie rock scene evolved, blending the nostalgic sounds of Britpop with new styles.</p>
    <p class="h5">Oasis: Britpop Titans</p>
    <p class="p">No discussion of 90s music in Manchester, the UK, or the world, is complete without Oasis. Formed by Liam and Noel Gallagher in 1991, Oasis shot to massive fame with their debut album, “Definitely Maybe”. Known for anthems like “Live Forever” and “Supersonic”, the band became synonymous with Britpop and Manchester as a whole. Their 1995 album, “(What’s the Story) Morning Glory?”, catapulted them to global stardom, with songs like “Wonderwall” and “Don’t Look Back in Anger” becoming instant classics.</p>
    <p class="p">Their 2009 Heaton Park gig was one of their last big performances before the band split in 2009 due to ongoing tensions between the Gallagher brothers. This legendary concert attracted over 210,000  fans to Heaton Park, marking a high point in the city’s Britpop history.</p>

    <p class="p">Oasis’s much-anticipated 2024 reunion brought the brothers back on stage, sparking nostalgia for longtime fans and excitement for a new generation. The concerts sold out in record time, cementing Manchester’s reputation as the home of Britpop.</p>
    <p class="h5">The Verve: Emotional and Orchestral</p>
    <p class="p">The Verve, led by Richard Ashcroft, brought a more introspective, symphonic style to Britpop with their 1997 hit, Bitter Sweet Symphony. The song became iconic, celebrated for its lush orchestration and emotional depth. Although The Verve faced their own ups and downs, with breakups and reformations, they left a lasting legacy on Manchester’s music scene and the Britpop genre.</p>
    <p class="h5">Black Grape: Eclectic and Experimental</p>
    <p class="p">After Happy Mondays, Shaun Ryder kept Manchester’s experimental spirit alive with Black Grape, a band that fused rock, funk, and rap in a way that felt fresh and chaotic. Their debut album, It’s Great When You’re Straight…Yeah, was a success, capturing the essence of Manchester’s eclectic music culture in the ’90s. Ryder’s unpredictable style kept Black Grape in the spotlight, embodying the rebellious energy of Manchester music.</p>
    <p class="h5">The Courteeners: Indie Anthems for the new millennium.</p>
    <p class="p">In the 2000s, much like the rest of the country, Manchester’s music scene began to shift towards indie rock, with The Courteeners emerging as one of the key bands of this era. Their 2008 debut, St. Jude, delivered catchy, relatable lyrics set to energetic indie rock. Tracks like “Not Nineteen Forever” quickly became anthems, resonating with fans across the UK and making The Courteeners one of Manchester’s modern indie rock icons.</p>
    <p class="h5">Elbow: Cinematic Rock with Local Pride</p>
    <p class="p">Elbow brought a different feel to Manchester’s indie scene with a sound that’s both introspective and grand. Their 2008 album, “The Seldom Seen Kid”, won a Mercury Prize and featured the hit “One Day Like This”, a song that’s often described as a “modern anthem.” Elbow’s music carries a distinct sense of place and pride, tying them to Manchester’s legacy of thoughtful, innovative music.</p>
    <p class="p">As the 2000s ended, Manchester’s musical influence continued to thrive, transitioning into a new era of indie pop and alternative rock with the rise of bands like Blossoms and Pale Waves in the next decade.</p>
