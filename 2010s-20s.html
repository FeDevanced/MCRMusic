    <p class="h2">New bands in town, and old giants making a comeback.</p>
    <p class="p">The 2010s brought a fresh wave of talent, and though the genre has shifted, the city’s music still carries that distinct Manchester edge. Bands like Blossoms, Pale Waves, and Everything Everything have drawn global attention, keeping the city on the music map with an updated, indie-pop twist. Meanwhile, solo acts from Noel and Liam Gallagher keep the Britpop legacy alive.</p>
    <p class="h5">Blossoms: Stockport Synth-Pop Sensations.</p>
    <p class="p">Blossoms, named after the Stockport pub where they first rehearsed, brought a fresh, synth-heavy sound to the indie scene. Their breakout single,“Charlemagne” introduced listeners to their unique blend of indie rock and synth-pop. Blossoms’ music is nostalgic yet modern, capturing both the spirit of their city and the current tastes of indie fans. The pub, now a favorite spot for fans to visit, has become a kind of pilgrimage site.</p>

    <p class="h5">Liam & Noel Gallagher: Solo Success</p>
    <p class="p">Even after Oasis, the Gallagher brothers continue to be a major part of Manchester’s music scene, each carving out successful solo careers. Noel Gallagher’s High Flying Birds released hits like “Holy Mountain” and “If I had a Gun…”, keeping to his roots with a modern twist. Liam’s solo work, like “Wall of Glass”, combines the classic Oasis grit with his signature swagger. Their rivalry remains a constant source of interest, but both brothers keep the city’s classic spirit alive through their individual music.</p>
    <p class="p">The 2024 Oasis reunion has been a massive moment for Manchester, bringing back the Britpop nostalgia and showing how Manchester’s music scene still captivates fans worldwide.</p>
    <p class="h5">Pale Waves: Gothic Pop with a Mancunian Edge</p>
    <p class="p">Pale Waves bought a dark, catchy edge to indie pop with their debut album “My Mind Makes Noises”, often blending 80s-inspired synth sounds with modern pop-rock. Songs like “Television Romance” have gained them a devoted fanbase, drawn to their relatable lyrics and moody sound. Known for their bold visuals and frontwoman Heather Baron-Gracie’s gothic style, Pale Waves continue to push Manchester’s music scene into new territory.</p>
    <p class="h5">Everything Everything: Art-Rock and Experimental Sounds</p>
    <p class="p">Everything Everything take indie rock into experimental realms, blending art-rock and electronica in a way that challenge genre norms. Their complex lyricism and eclectic sound set them apart as one of the most inventive bands to come out of the city. Tracks like Cough Cough and Desire showcase lead singer Jonathan Higgs’ ability to marry thoughtful, emotional songwriting with politically charged lyrics, catchy hooks and layered instrumentation.</p>
    <p class="h5">New Order & The Stone Roses: The Reunion Era</p>
    <p class="p">The reunion trend began far before Oasis, reaching some of Manchester’s other iconic groups. New Order continues to tour, bringing back their unique post-punk and electronic sound, while The Stone Roses reunited for a series of concerts that reignited Madchester nostalgia in the 2010s. These reunions have kept Manchester’s legacy alive for both longtime fans and younger audiences.</p>
    <p class="p">As the 2020s continue, Manchester’s music scene remains vibrant and varied. From the Britpop anthems of Oasis to the synth-driven sound of Blossoms and Pale Waves’ moody pop, Manchester’s influence on music spans genres and generations. The city’s ever-evolving music culture proves that Manchester isn’t just a part of music history, it's a crucial part of its future.</p>
